    "# Introduction \n",
    "We’ve seen that basic plots may be produced in MATLAB by following three steps: produce an appropriate selection of x values; generate the corresponding y = f (x) values; plot the two vectors with the command plot(x,y).\n",
    "In this project we show how to handle various situations that arise when plotting functions that require us to think before we start making our plots. These include: figuring out an appropriate domain for the plot; plotting functions with vertical asymptotes; plotting more than one function on the same graph; and plotting functions which are defined differently over different intervals. Additionally, we learn how to add color, labels, and titles to a figure."

    "# Using zoom to explore a figure\n",
    "Once a function is plotted, we typically want to use the figure to answer questions about the func- tion. Example questions are: When does the function equal 0? When is the function at its lowest point? Where is the function increasing? These can be answered by focusing on one or two points on the graph. To read the values of these points we can use the label on the x and y axes. However, to get more precise answers it is useful to be able to “zoom” in on the graph to narrow the range of the axes. This can be done by replotting the function over a smaller domain. This is recommended if you want the most accuracy. However, the zoom function allows us to quickly (if not roughly) identify these points of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The zoom feature may be turned on by entering the command >> zoom on and turned off by entering the command >> zoom off. Alternately, on the figure window are two icons for setting the zoom features. These are shown in Figure 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking the + magnifying glass allows you to zoom into a figure. When you click the mouse anywhere in the figure, the figure will be replotted using 1/2 of each axis; in effect, you zoom in by a power of 4. If you want more than this, you can use the mouse to drag out a box on the figure. When the mouse button is released the highlighted window area is shown. The - magnifying glass reverses the zoom style."

    "# Identifying an appropriate domain\n",
    "MATLAB can’t think for us, but it can help us “think easier.” Case in point, we’re often interested in plotting a function on only part of its domain. This may be where a function makes sense for a physical problem such as non-negative time, or non-negative area. Or, it may be where we can identify one cycle of a periodic function. We can analyze the function to do this, or we can use MATLAB to explore some graphs and from these decide upon an appropriate domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1\n",
    "A baseball is thrown from center field towards home plate. Its height, y, varies as a function of time, t. It is known from high-school physics that a model for this is given by the projectile motion formula $$y = y_0 + v_0t - \\frac12 at^2,$$ where $y_0$ and $v_0$ are the initial height and upward velocity, and $a$ is the constant of acceleration. In 2\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose a ball is thrown with an initial velocity of $v_0 = 10$ meters per second upward from an initial height of $y_0 = 2$ meters. On what realistic domain will $y(t) \\ge 0$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, $y(t)$ is a parabola which opens downward as the $t^2$ coefficient is negative. We\n",
    "could use formulas to find a parabola’s zeroes, but using MATLAB we can have fun exploring the graph just as easily. First, we make an initial plot of the data over the interval $[0,10]$. Why that? Well time must be non-negative so t ≥ 0 is natural. As for 10, since this is supposed to model a ball being thrown, 10 seconds should be long enough, if the model is realistic."
